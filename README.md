# About my first PORTFOLIO 
I have developed my first portfolio website, utilizing primarily HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional design. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in web development, demonstrating proficiency in front-end technologies and attention to detail in crafting a user-friendly interface.
My portfolio website includes comprehensive details about my professional journey, featuring my CV, skills, work experience, certifications, and contact information. This structured presentation provides a holistic view of my qualifications and achievements, offering visitors an in-depth understanding of my capabilities and expertise.
